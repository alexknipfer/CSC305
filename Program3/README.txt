PLATFORM:
Program was developed on Fedora 19. The editor used was geany. The database system
used was MySQL(MariaDB) and the server used was httpd(Apache).

USING THE WEBSITE:
When you first open the main menu index.html you need to go to the setup 
credentials page to enter your username and password for your MySQL database.
You must login first in order to use any of the other pages. This is so you
can query the database in the other pages. After that everything should be good
to go. The tables are created for you when you run the credentials page. 
All that needs to be done is create a database in MySQL called 
RecipeManager and then everything else is done for you. 

KNOWN BUGS:
I have not noticed any bugs but there could be some that have just not come up
for me. 

SOLUTION:
My solution was to get all the HTML files written and then create one php file at
a time to make sure it works 100% and then move to the next one. Then I tested 
the site to make sure everything worked. I believe everything works as it should
but there could always be some errors that I did not catch.
